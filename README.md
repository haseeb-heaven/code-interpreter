## 🔐 Authentication Options

Choose the authentication method that best fits your needs:

### Option 1: Sign in with Google (OAuth login using your Google Account)

**✨ Best for:** Individual developers as well as anyone who has a Gemini Code
Assist License. (see
[quota limits and terms of service](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/quotas)
for details)

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day
- **Gemini 3 models** with 1M token context window
- **No API key management** - just sign in with your Google account
- **Automatic updates** to latest models

#### Start Gemini CLI, then choose _Sign in with Google_ and follow the browser authentication flow when prompted

```bash
gemini
```

#### If you are using a paid Code Assist License from your organization, remember to set the Google Cloud Project

```bash
# Set your Google Cloud Project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
gemini
```

### Option 2: Gemini API Key

**✨ Best for:** Developers who need specific model control or paid tier access

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 1000 requests/day with Gemini 3 (mix of flash and pro)
- **Model selection**: Choose specific Gemini models
- **Usage-based billing**: Upgrade for higher limits when needed

```bash
# Get your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
gemini
```

### Option 3: Vertex AI

**✨ Best for:** Enterprise teams and production workloads

**Benefits:**

- **Enterprise features**: Advanced security and compliance
- **Scalable**: Higher rate limits with billing account
- **Integration**: Works with existing Google Cloud infrastructure

```bash
# Get your key from Google Cloud Console
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true
gemini
```

For Google Workspace accounts and other authentication methods, see the
[authentication guide](https://www.geminicli.com/docs/get-started/authentication).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
gemini
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
gemini --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```

For real-time event streaming (useful for monitoring long-running operations),
use `--output-format stream-json` to get newline-delimited JSON events:

```bash
gemini -p "Run tests and deploy" --output-format stream-json
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
gemini
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
