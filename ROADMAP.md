# Gemini CLI Roadmap

The
[Official Gemini CLI Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/google-gemini/projects/11/)

Gemini CLI is an open-source AI agent that brings the power of Gemini directly
into your terminal. It provides lightweight access to Gemini, giving you the
most direct path from your prompt to our model.

This document outlines our approach to the Gemini CLI roadmap. Here, you'll find
our guiding principles and a breakdown of the key areas we are focused on for
development. Our roadmap is not a static list but a dynamic set of priorities
that are tracked live in our GitHub Issues.

As an
[Apache 2.0 open source project](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli?tab=Apache-2.0-1-ov-file#readme),
we appreciate and welcome
[public contributions](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md),
and will give first priority to those contributions aligned with our roadmap. If
you want to propose a new feature or change to our roadmap, please start by
[opening an issue for discussion](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/new/choose).

## Disclaimer

This roadmap represents our current thinking and is for informational purposes
only. It is not a commitment or a guarantee of future delivery. The development,
release, and timing of any features are subject to change, and we may update the
roadmap based on community discussions as well as when our priorities evolve.

## Guiding Principles

Our development is guided by the following principles:

- **Power & Simplicity:** Deliver access to state-of-the-art Gemini models with
  an intuitive and easy-to-use lightweight command-line interface.
- **Extensibility:** An adaptable agent to help you with a variety of use cases
  and environments along with the ability to run these agents anywhere.
- **Intelligent:** Gemini CLI should be reliably ranked among the best agentic
  tools as measured by benchmarks like SWE Bench, Terminal Bench, and CSAT.
- **Free and Open Source:** Foster a thriving open source community where cost
  isn’t a barrier to personal use, and PRs get merged quickly. This means
  resolving and closing issues, pull requests, and discussion posts quickly.

## How the Roadmap Works

Our roadmap is managed directly through GitHub Issues. See our entry point
Roadmap Issue [here](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/4191).
This approach allows for transparency and gives you a direct way to learn more
or get involved with any specific initiative. All our roadmap items will be
tagged as Type:`Feature` and Label:`maintainer` for features we are actively
working on, or Type:`Task` and Label:`maintainer` for a more detailed list of
tasks.

Issues are organized to provide key information at a glance:

- **Target Quarter:** `Milestone` denotes the anticipated delivery timeline.
- **Feature Area:** Labels such as `area/model` or `area/tooling` categorize the
  work.
- **Issue Type:** _Workstream_ => _Epics_ => _Features_ => _Tasks|Bugs_

To see what we're working on, you can filter our issues by these dimensions. See
all our items [here](https://github.com/orgs/google-gemini/projects/11/views/19)

## Focus Areas

To better organize our efforts, we categorize our work into several key feature
areas. These labels are used on our GitHub Issues to help you filter and find
initiatives that interest you.

- **Authentication:** Secure user access via API keys, Gemini Code Assist login,
  etc.
- **Model:** Support new Gemini models, multi-modality, local execution, and
  performance tuning.
- **User Experience:** Improve the CLI's usability, performance, interactive
  features, and documentation.
- **Tooling:** Built-in tools and the MCP ecosystem.
- **Core:** Core functionality of the CLI
- **Extensibility:** Bringing Gemini CLI to other surfaces e.g. GitHub.
- **Contribution:** Improve the contribution process via test automation and
  CI/CD pipeline enhancements.
- **Platform:** Manage installation, OS support, and the underlying CLI
  framework.
- **Quality:** Focus on testing, reliability, performance, and overall product
  quality.
- **Background Agents:** Enable long-running, autonomous tasks and proactive
  assistance.
- **Security and Privacy:** For all things related to security and privacy

## How to Contribute

Gemini CLI is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the
community! Whether you're a developer, a designer, or just an enthusiastic user
