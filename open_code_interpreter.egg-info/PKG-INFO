## ⚙️ **Settings**
You can customize the settings of the current model from the `.config` file. It contains all the necessary parameters such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and more.

### **Steps to add your own custom API Server**
To integrate your own API server for OpenAI instead of the default server, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the `Configs` directory.
2. Open the configuration file for the model you want to modify. This could be either `gpt-3.5-turbo.config` or `gpt-4.config`.
3. Add the following line at the end of the file:
   ```
   api_base = https://my-custom-base.com
   ```
   Replace `https://my-custom-base.com` with the URL of your custom API server.
4. Save and close the file.
Now, whenever you select the `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` model, the system will automatically use your custom server.

### **Steps to add new Hugging Face model**

1. 📋 Copy the `.config` file and rename it to `configs/hf-model-new.config`.
2. 🛠️ Modify the parameters of the model like `start_sep`, `end_sep`, `skip_first_line`.
3. 📝 Set the model name from Hugging Face to `HF_MODEL = 'Model name here'`.
4. 🚀 Now, you can use it like this: `python interpreter.py -m 'hf-model-new' -md 'code' -e`.
5. 📁 Make sure the `-m 'hf-model-new'` matches the config file inside the `configs` folder.
