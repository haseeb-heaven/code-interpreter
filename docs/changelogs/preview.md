# Preview release: v0.51.0-preview.0

Released: July 8, 2026

Our preview release includes the latest, new, and experimental features. This
release may not be as stable as our [latest weekly release](latest.md).

To install the preview release:

```
npm install -g open-agent@preview
```

## Highlights

- **Caretaker Cloud Run Services**: Implemented a Cloud Run webhook ingestion
  service and egress service skeleton to support advanced caretaker features.
- **Enhanced Security & Sandbox Hardening**: Enforced a case-insensitive
  sensitive path blocklist and VS Code human-in-the-loop (HITL) checks, resolved
  a directory escape vulnerability in the memory import processor, and marked
  `~/.gitconfig` as read-only within the macOS sandbox.
- **Improved Thought Leakage and Escape Handling**: Resolved potential thought
  leakage by stripping thinking/thought processes from scrubbed history turns,
  and ensured escape sequences in string literals are correctly preserved for
  modern models.
- **Robust Path & API Updates**: Enhanced defensive path resolution for
  at-reference files, and updated the Vertex AI base URL configuration to
  support the latest API updates.
