# Todo tool (`write_todos`)

The `write_todos` tool allows the Gemini agent to maintain an internal list of
subtasks for multi-step requests.

## Technical reference

The agent uses this tool to manage its execution plan and provide progress
updates to the CLI interface.

### Arguments

- `todos` (array of objects, required): The complete list of tasks. Each object
  includes:
  - `description` (string): Technical description of the task.
  - `status` (enum): `pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, or
    `blocked`.

## Technical behavior

- **Interface:** Updates the progress indicator above the CLI input prompt.
- **Exclusivity:** Only one task can be marked `in_progress` at any time.
- **Persistence:** Todo state is scoped to the current session.
- **Interaction:** Users can toggle the full list view using **Ctrl+T**.

## Use cases

- Breaking down a complex feature implementation into manageable steps.
- Coordinating multi-file refactoring tasks.
- Providing visibility into the agent's current focus during long-running tasks.
