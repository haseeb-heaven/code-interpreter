# Web fetch tool (`web_fetch`)

The `web_fetch` tool allows the Gemini agent to retrieve and process content
from specific URLs provided in your prompt.

## Technical reference

The agent uses this tool when you include URLs in your prompt and request
specific operations like summarization or extraction.

### Arguments

- `prompt` (string, required): A request containing up to 20 valid URLs
  (starting with `http://` or `https://`) and instructions on how to process
  them.

## Technical behavior

- **Confirmation:** Triggers a confirmation dialog showing the converted URLs.
- **Plan Mode:** In [Plan Mode](../cli/plan-mode.md), `web_fetch` is available
  but always requires explicit user confirmation (`ask_user`) due to security
  implications of accessing external or private network addresses.
- **Processing:** Uses the Gemini API's `urlContext` for retrieval.
- **Fallback:** If API access fails, the tool attempts to fetch raw content
  directly from your local machine.
- **Formatting:** Returns a synthesized response with source attribution.

## Use cases

- Summarizing technical articles or blog posts.
- Comparing data between two or more web pages.
- Extracting specific information from a documentation site.
