# Gemini CLI: Quotas and pricing

Gemini CLI offers a generous free tier that covers many individual developers'
use cases. For enterprise or professional usage, or if you need increased quota,
several options are available depending on your authentication account type.

For a high-level comparison of available subscriptions and to select the right

Generally, there are three categories to choose from:

- Free Usage: Ideal for experimentation and light use.
- Paid Tier (fixed price): For individual developers or enterprises who need
  more generous daily quotas and predictable costs.
- Pay-As-You-Go: The most flexible option for professional use, long-running
  tasks, or when you need full control over your usage.

Requests are limited per user per minute and are subject to the availability of
the service in times of high demand.

## Free usage

Access to Gemini CLI begins with a generous free tier, perfect for
experimentation and light use.

Your free usage is governed by the following limits, which depend on your
authorization type.

### Log in with Google (Gemini Code Assist for individuals)

For users who authenticate by using their Google account to access Gemini Code
Assist for individuals. This includes:

- 1000 maximum model requests / user / day
- Model requests will be made across the Gemini model family as determined by
  Gemini CLI.

[Gemini Code Assist for Individuals Limits](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/resources/quotas#quotas-for-agent-mode-gemini-cli).

### Log in with Gemini API Key (unpaid)

If you are using a Gemini API key, you can also benefit from a free tier. This
includes:

- 250 maximum model requests / user / day
- Model requests to Flash model only.

Learn more at
[Gemini API Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits).

### Log in with Vertex AI (Express Mode)

Vertex AI offers an Express Mode without the need to enable billing. This
includes:

- 90 days before you need to enable billing.
- Quotas and models are specific to your account and their limits vary.

[Vertex AI Express Mode Limits](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/express-mode/overview#quotas).

## Paid tier: Higher limits for a fixed cost

If you use up your initial number of requests, you can continue to benefit from
Gemini CLI by upgrading to one of the following subscriptions:

### Individuals

These tiers apply when you sign in with a personal account. To verify whether
you're on a personal account, visit
[Google One](https://one.google.com/about/plans?hl=en-US&g1_landing_page=0):

- If you are on a personal account, you will see your personal dashboard.
- If you are not on a personal account, you will see: "You're currently signed
  in to your Google Workspace Account."

**Supported tiers:** _- Tiers not listed above, including Google AI Plus, are
not supported._

- [Google AI Pro and AI Ultra](https://gemini.google/subscriptions/). This is
  recommended for individual developers. Quotas and pricing are based on a fixed
  price subscription.

  For predictable costs, you can log in with Google.

  [Gemini Code Assist Quotas and Limits](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/resources/quotas)

### Through your organization

These tiers are applicable when you are signing in with a Google Workspace
account.

- To verify your account type, visit
  [the Google One page](https://one.google.com/about/plans?hl=en-US&g1_landing_page=0).
- You are on a workspace account if you see the message "You're currently signed
  in to your Google Workspace Account".

**Supported tiers:** _- Tiers not listed above, including Workspace AI
Standard/Plus and AI Expanded, are not supported._

- [Workspace AI Ultra Access](https://workspace.google.com/products/ai-ultra/).
- [Purchase a Gemini Code Assist Subscription through Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/overview).

  Quotas and pricing are based on a fixed price subscription with assigned
  license seats. For predictable costs, you can sign in with Google.

  This includes the following request limits:

  - Gemini Code Assist Standard edition:
    - 1500 maximum model requests / user / day
  - Gemini Code Assist Enterprise edition:
    - 2000 maximum model requests / user / day
  - Model requests will be made across the Gemini model family as determined by
    Gemini CLI.

## Pay as you go

If you hit your daily request limits or exhaust your Gemini Pro quota even after
upgrading, the most flexible solution is to switch to a pay-as-you-go model,
where you pay for the specific amount of processing you use. This is the
recommended path for uninterrupted access.

To do this, log in using a Gemini API key or Vertex AI.

### Vertex AI (regular mode)

An enterprise-grade platform for building, deploying, and managing AI models,
including Gemini. It offers enhanced security, data governance, and integration
with other Google Cloud services.

- Quota: Governed by a dynamic shared quota system or pre-purchased provisioned
  throughput.
- Cost: Based on model and token usage.

Learn more at
[Vertex AI Dynamic Shared Quota](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/resources/dynamic-shared-quota)
and [Vertex AI Pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing).

### Gemini API key

Ideal for developers who want to quickly build applications with the Gemini
models. This is the most direct way to use the models.

- Quota: Varies by pricing tier.
- Cost: Varies by pricing tier and model/token usage.

Learn more at
[Gemini API Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits),
[Gemini API Pricing](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/pricing)

It’s important to highlight that when using an API key, you pay per token/call.
This can be more expensive for many small calls with few tokens, but it's the
only way to ensure your workflow isn't interrupted by reaching a limit on your
quota.

## Gemini for workspace plans

These plans currently apply only to the use of Gemini web-based products
provided by Google-based experiences (for example, the Gemini web app or the
Flow video editor). These plans do not apply to the API usage which powers the
Gemini CLI. Supporting these plans is under active consideration for future
support.

## Check usage and limits

You can check your current token usage and applicable limits using the
`/stats model` command. This command provides a snapshot of your current
session's token usage, as well as information about the limits associated with
your current quota.

For more information on the `/stats` command and its subcommands, see the
[Command Reference](../reference/commands.md#stats).

A summary of model usage is also presented on exit at the end of a session.

## Tips to avoid high costs

When using a pay-as-you-go plan, be mindful of your usage to avoid unexpected
costs.

- **Be selective with suggestions**: Before accepting a suggestion, especially
  for a computationally intensive task like refactoring a large codebase,
  consider if it's the most cost-effective approach.
- **Use precise prompts**: You are paying per call, so think about the most
  efficient way to get your desired result. A well-crafted prompt can often get
  you the answer you need in a single call, rather than multiple back-and-forth
  interactions.
- **Monitor your usage**: Use the `/stats model` command to track your token
  usage during a session. This can help you stay aware of your spending in real
  time.
