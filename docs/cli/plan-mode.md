# Plan Mode

Plan Mode is a read-only environment for architecting robust solutions before
implementation. With Plan Mode, you can:

- **Research:** Explore the project in a read-only state to prevent accidental
  changes.
- **Design:** Understand problems, evaluate trade-offs, and choose a solution.
- **Plan:** Align on an execution strategy before any code is modified.

Plan Mode is enabled by default. You can manage this setting using the
`/settings` command.

## How to enter Plan Mode

Plan Mode integrates seamlessly into your workflow, letting you switch between
planning and execution as needed.

You can either configure open-agent to start in Plan Mode by default or enter
Plan Mode manually during a session.

### Launch in Plan Mode

To start open-agent directly in Plan Mode by default:

1.  Use the `/settings` command.
2.  Set **Default Approval Mode** to `Plan`.

To launch open-agent in Plan Mode once:

1. Use `openagent --approval-mode=plan` when launching open-agent.

### Enter Plan Mode manually

To start Plan Mode while using open-agent:

- **Keyboard shortcut:** Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle through approval modes
  (`Default` -> `Auto-Edit` -> `Plan`). Plan Mode is automatically removed from
  the rotation when open-agent is actively processing or showing confirmation
  dialogs.

- **Command:** Type `/plan [goal]` in the input box. The `[goal]` is optional;
  for example, `/plan implement authentication` will switch to Plan Mode and
  immediately submit the prompt to the model.

- **Natural Language:** Ask open-agent to "start a plan for...". Open-agent
  calls the
  [`enter_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#1-enter_plan_mode-enterplanmode) tool
  to switch modes. This tool is not available when open-agent is in
  [YOLO mode](../reference/configuration.md#command-line-arguments).

## How to use Plan Mode

Plan Mode lets you collaborate with open-agent to design a solution before
open-agent takes action.

1.  **Provide a goal:** Start by describing what you want to achieve. Open-agent
    will then enter Plan Mode (if it's not already) to research the task.
2.  **Discuss and agree on strategy:** As open-agent analyzes your codebase, it
    will discuss its findings and proposed strategy with you to ensure
    alignment. It may ask you questions or present different implementation
    options using [`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md). **Open-agent will stop and
    wait for your confirmation** before drafting the formal plan. You should
    reach an informal agreement on the approach before proceeding.
3.  **Review the plan:** Once you've agreed on the strategy, open-agent creates
    a detailed implementation plan as a Markdown file in your plans directory.

    - **View:** You can open and read this file to understand the proposed
      changes.
    - **Edit:** Press `Ctrl+X` to open the plan directly in your configured
      external editor.

4.  **Approve or iterate:** Open-agent will present the finalized plan for your
    formal approval.
    - **Approve:** If you're satisfied with the plan, approve it to start the
      implementation immediately: **Yes, automatically accept edits** or **Yes,
      manually accept edits**.
    - **Iterate:** If the plan needs adjustments, provide feedback in the input
      box or [edit the plan file directly](#collaborative-plan-editing).
      Open-agent will refine the strategy and update the plan.
    - **Cancel:** You can cancel your plan with `Esc`.

For more complex or specialized planning tasks, you can
[customize the planning workflow with skills](#custom-planning-with-skills).

### Collaborative plan editing

You can collaborate with open-agent by making direct changes or leaving comments
in the implementation plan. This is often faster and more precise than
describing complex changes in natural language.

1.  **Open the plan:** Press `Ctrl+X` when open-agent presents a plan for
    review.
2.  **Edit or comment:** The plan opens in your configured external editor (for
    example, VS Code or Vim). You can:
    - **Modify steps:** Directly reorder, delete, or rewrite implementation
      steps.
    - **Leave comments:** Add inline questions or feedback (for example, "Wait,
      shouldn't we use the existing `Logger` class here?").
3.  **Save and close:** Save your changes and close the editor.
4.  **Review and refine:** Open-agent automatically detects the changes, reviews
    your comments, and adjusts the implementation strategy. It then presents the
    refined plan for your final approval.

## How to exit Plan Mode

You can exit Plan Mode at any time, whether you have finalized a plan or want to
switch back to another mode.

- **Approve a plan:** When open-agent presents a finalized plan, approving it
  automatically exits Plan Mode and starts the implementation.
- **Keyboard shortcut:** Press `Shift+Tab` to cycle to the desired mode.
- **Natural language:** Ask open-agent to "exit plan mode" or "stop planning."

## Tool Restrictions

Plan Mode enforces strict safety policies to prevent accidental changes.

These are the only allowed tools:

- **FileSystem (Read):**
  [`read_file`](../tools/file-system.md#2-read_file-readfile),
  [`list_directory`](../tools/file-system.md#1-list_directory-readfolder),
  [`glob`](../tools/file-system.md#4-glob-findfiles)
- **Search:** [`grep_search`](../tools/file-system.md#5-grep_search-searchtext),
  [`google_web_search`](../tools/web-search.md),
  [`web_fetch`](../tools/web-fetch.md) (requires explicit confirmation),
  [`get_internal_docs`](../tools/internal-docs.md)
- **Research Subagents:**
  [`codebase_investigator`](../core/subagents.md#codebase-investigator),
  [`cli_help`](../core/subagents.md#cli-help-agent)
- **Interaction:** [`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md)
- **MCP tools (Read):** Read-only [MCP tools](../tools/mcp-server.md) (for
  example, `github_read_issue`, `postgres_read_schema`) and core
  [MCP resource tools](../tools/mcp-resources.md) (`list_mcp_resources`,
  `read_mcp_resource`) are allowed.
- **Planning (Write):**
  [`write_file`](../tools/file-system.md#3-write_file-writefile) and
  [`replace`](../tools/file-system.md#6-replace-edit) only allowed for `.md`
  files in the `~/.openagent/tmp/<project>/<session-id>/plans/` directory or
  your [custom plans directory](#custom-plan-directory-and-policies).
- **Skills:** [`activate_skill`](../cli/skills.md) (allows loading specialized
  instructions and resources in a read-only manner)

## Customization and best practices

Plan Mode is secure by default, but you can adapt it to fit your specific
workflows. You can customize how open-agent plans by using skills, adjusting
safety policies, changing where plans are stored, or adding hooks.

### Custom planning with skills

You can use [Agent Skills](../cli/skills.md) to customize how open-agent
approaches planning for specific types of tasks. When a skill is activated
during Plan Mode, its specialized instructions and procedural workflows will
guide the research, design, and planning phases.

For example:

- A **"Database Migration"** skill could ensure the plan includes data safety
  checks and rollback strategies.
- A **"Security Audit"** skill could prompt open-agent to look for specific
  vulnerabilities during codebase exploration.
- A **"Frontend Design"** skill could guide open-agent to use specific UI
  components and accessibility standards in its proposal.

To use a skill in Plan Mode, you can explicitly ask open-agent to "use the
`<skill-name>` skill to plan..." or open-agent may autonomously activate it
based on the task description.

### Custom policies

Plan Mode's default tool restrictions are managed by the
[policy engine](../reference/policy-engine.md) and defined in the built-in
[`plan.toml`] file. The built-in policy (Tier 1) enforces the read-only state,
but you can customize these rules by creating your own policies in your
`~/.openagent/policies/` directory (Tier 2).

#### Global vs. mode-specific rules

As described in the
[policy engine documentation](../reference/policy-engine.md#approval-modes), any
rule that does not explicitly specify `modes` is considered "always active" and
will apply to Plan Mode as well.

To maintain the integrity of Plan Mode as a safe research environment,
persistent tool approvals are context-aware. Approvals granted in modes like
Default or Auto-Edit do not apply to Plan Mode, ensuring that tools trusted for
implementation don't automatically execute while you're researching. However,
approvals granted while in Plan Mode are treated as intentional choices for
global trust and apply to all modes.

If you want to manually restrict a rule to other modes but _not_ to Plan Mode,
you must explicitly specify the target modes. For example, to allow `npm test`
in default and Auto-Edit modes but not in Plan Mode:

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "npm test"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
# By omitting "plan", this rule will not be active in Plan Mode.
modes = ["default", "autoEdit"]
```

#### Example: Automatically approve read-only MCP tools

By default, read-only MCP tools require user confirmation in Plan Mode. You can
use `toolAnnotations` and the `mcpName` wildcard to customize this behavior for
your specific environment.

`~/.openagent/policies/mcp-read-only.toml`

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "*"
mcpName = "*"
toolAnnotations = { readOnlyHint = true }
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
modes = ["plan"]
```

For more information on how the policy engine works, see the
[policy engine](../reference/policy-engine.md) docs.

#### Example: Allow git commands in Plan Mode

This rule lets you check the repository status and see changes while in Plan
Mode.

`~/.openagent/policies/git-research.toml`

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = ["git status", "git diff"]
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
modes = ["plan"]
```

#### Example: Enable custom subagents in Plan Mode

Built-in research [subagents](../core/subagents.md) like
[`codebase_investigator`](../core/subagents.md#codebase-investigator) and
[`cli_help`](../core/subagents.md#cli-help-agent) are enabled by default in Plan
Mode. You can enable additional
[custom subagents](../core/subagents.md#creating-custom-subagents) by adding a
rule to your policy.

`~/.openagent/policies/research-subagents.toml`

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "my_custom_subagent"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
modes = ["plan"]
```

Tell open-agent it can use these tools in your prompt, for example: _"You can
check ongoing changes in git."_

### Custom plan directory and policies

By default, planning artifacts are stored in a managed temporary directory
outside your project: `~/.openagent/tmp/<project>/<session-id>/plans/`.

You can configure a custom directory for plans in your `settings.json`. For
example, to store plans in a `.openagent/plans` directory within your project:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "plan": {
      "directory": ".openagent/plans"
    }
  }
}
```

To maintain the safety of Plan Mode, user-configured paths for the plans
directory are restricted to the project root. This ensures that custom planning
locations defined within a project's workspace cannot be used to escape and
overwrite sensitive files elsewhere. Any user-configured directory must reside
within the project boundary.

Using a custom directory requires updating your
[policy engine](../reference/policy-engine.md) configurations to allow
`write_file` and `replace` in that specific location. For example, to allow
writing to the `.openagent/plans` directory within your project, create a policy
file at `~/.openagent/policies/plan-custom-directory.toml`:

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = ["write_file", "replace"]
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
modes = ["plan"]
# Adjust the pattern to match your custom directory.
# This example matches any .md file in a .openagent/plans directory within the project.
argsPattern = "\"file_path\":\"[^\"]+[\\\\/]+\\.openagent[\\\\/]+plans[\\\\/]+[\\w-]+\\.md\""
```

### Using hooks with Plan Mode

You can use the [hook system](../hooks/writing-hooks.md) to automate parts of
the planning workflow or enforce additional checks when open-agent transitions
into or out of Plan Mode.

Hooks such as `BeforeTool` or `AfterTool` can be configured to intercept the
`enter_plan_mode` and `exit_plan_mode` tool calls.

> [!WARNING] When hooks are triggered by **tool executions**, they do **not**
> run when you manually toggle Plan Mode using the `/plan` command or the
> `Shift+Tab` keyboard shortcut. If you need hooks to execute on mode changes,
> ensure the transition is initiated by the agent (for example, by asking "start
> a plan for...").

#### Example: Archive approved plans to GCS (`AfterTool`)

If your organizational policy requires a record of all execution plans, you can
use an `AfterTool` hook to securely copy the plan artifact to Google Cloud
Storage whenever open-agent exits Plan Mode to start the implementation.

**`.openagent/hooks/archive-plan.sh`:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Extract the plan filename from the tool input JSON
plan_filename=$(jq -r '.tool_input.plan_filename // empty')

# Construct the absolute path using the GEMINI_PLANS_DIR environment variable
plan_path="$GEMINI_PLANS_DIR/$plan_filename"

if [ -f "$plan_path" ]; then
  # Generate a unique filename using a timestamp
  filename="$(date +%s)_$(basename "$plan_path")"

  # Upload the plan to GCS in the background so it doesn't block the CLI
  gsutil cp "$plan_path" "gs://my-audit-bucket/openagent-plans/$filename" > /dev/null 2>&1 &
fi

# AfterTool hooks should generally allow the flow to continue
echo '{"decision": "allow"}'
```

To register this `AfterTool` hook, add it to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "AfterTool": [
      {
        "matcher": "exit_plan_mode",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "name": "archive-plan",
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.openagent/hooks/archive-plan.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Commands

- **`/plan copy`**: Copy the currently approved plan to your clipboard.

## Planning workflows

Plan Mode provides building blocks for structured research and design. These are
implemented as [extensions](../extensions/index.md) using core planning tools
like [`enter_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#1-enter_plan_mode-enterplanmode),
[`exit_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#2-exit_plan_mode-exitplanmode), and
[`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md).

### Built-in planning workflow

The built-in planner uses an adaptive workflow to analyze your project, consult
you on trade-offs via [`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md), and draft a plan for
your approval.

### Custom planning workflows

You can install or create specialized planners to suit your workflow.

#### Conductor

[Conductor] is designed for spec-driven development. It organizes work into
"tracks" and stores persistent artifacts in your project's `conductor/`
directory:

- **Automate transitions:** Switches to read-only mode via
  [`enter_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#1-enter_plan_mode-enterplanmode).
- **Streamline decisions:** Uses [`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md) for
  architectural choices.
- **Maintain project context:** Stores artifacts in the project directory using
  [custom plan directory and policies](#custom-plan-directory-and-policies).
- **Handoff execution:** Transitions to implementation via
  [`exit_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#2-exit_plan_mode-exitplanmode).

#### Build your own

Since Plan Mode is built on modular building blocks, you can develop your own
custom planning workflow as an [extensions](../extensions/index.md). By
leveraging core tools and [custom policies](#custom-policies), you can define
how open-agent researches and stores plans for your specific domain.

To build a custom planning workflow, you can use:

- **Tool usage:** Use core tools like
  [`enter_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#1-enter_plan_mode-enterplanmode),
  [`ask_user`](../tools/ask-user.md), and
  [`exit_plan_mode`](../tools/planning.md#2-exit_plan_mode-exitplanmode) to
  manage the research and design process.
- **Customization:** Set your own storage locations and policy rules using
  [custom plan directories](#custom-plan-directory-and-policies) and
  [custom policies](#custom-policies).

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!TIP]
> Use [Conductor] as a reference when building your own custom
> planning workflow.

By using Plan Mode as its execution environment, your custom methodology can
enforce read-only safety during the design phase while benefiting from
high-reasoning model routing.

## Automatic Model Routing

When using an [auto model](../reference/configuration.md#model), open-agent
automatically optimizes [model routing](../cli/telemetry.md#model-routing) based
on the current phase of your task:

1.  **Planning Phase:** While in Plan Mode, the CLI routes requests to a
    high-reasoning **Pro** model to ensure robust architectural decisions and
    high-quality plans.
2.  **Implementation Phase:** Once a plan is approved and you exit Plan Mode,
    the CLI detects the existence of the approved plan and automatically
    switches to a high-speed **Flash** model. This provides a faster, more
    responsive experience during the implementation of the plan.

If the high-reasoning model is unavailable or you don't have access to it,
open-agent automatically and silently falls back to a faster model to ensure
your workflow isn't interrupted.

This behavior is enabled by default to provide the best balance of quality and
performance. You can disable this automatic switching in your settings:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "plan": {
      "modelRouting": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Cleanup

By default, open-agent automatically cleans up old session data, including all
associated plan files and task trackers.

- **Default behavior:** Sessions (and their plans) are retained for **30 days**.
- **Configuration:** You can customize this behavior via the `/settings` command
  (search for **Enable Session Cleanup** or **Keep chat history**) or in your
  `settings.json` file. See
  [session retention](../cli/session-management.md#session-retention) for more
  details.

Manual deletion also removes all associated artifacts:

- **Command Line:** Use `openagent --delete-session <index|id>`.
- **Session Browser:** Press `/resume`, navigate to a session, and press `x`.

If you use a [custom plans directory](#custom-plan-directory-and-policies),
those files are not automatically deleted and must be managed manually.

## Non-interactive execution

When running open-agent in non-interactive environments (such as headless
scripts or CI/CD pipelines), Plan Mode optimizes for automated workflows:

- **Automatic transitions:** The policy engine automatically approves the
  `enter_plan_mode` and `exit_plan_mode` tools without prompting for user
  confirmation.
- **Automated implementation:** When exiting Plan Mode to execute the plan,
  open-agent automatically switches to
  [YOLO mode](../reference/policy-engine.md#approval-modes) instead of the
  standard Default mode. This allows the CLI to execute the implementation steps
  automatically without hanging on interactive tool approvals.

**Example:**

```bash
openagent --approval-mode plan -p "Analyze telemetry and suggest improvements"
```
