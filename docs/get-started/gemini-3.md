## How to get started with Gemini 3 on Gemini CLI

Get started by upgrading Gemini CLI to the latest version:

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli@latest
```

If your version is 0.21.1 or later:

1. Run `/model`.
2. Select **Auto (Gemini 3)**.

For more information, see [Gemini CLI model selection](../cli/model.md).

### Usage limits and fallback

Gemini CLI will tell you when you reach your Gemini 3 Pro daily usage limit.
When you encounter that limit, you’ll be given the option to switch to Gemini
2.5 Pro, upgrade for higher limits, or stop. You’ll also be told when your usage
limit resets and Gemini 3 Pro can be used again.

Similarly, when you reach your daily usage limit for Gemini 2.5 Pro, you’ll see
a message prompting fallback to Gemini 2.5 Flash.

### Capacity errors

There may be times when the Gemini 3 Pro model is overloaded. When that happens,
Gemini CLI will ask you to decide whether you want to keep trying Gemini 3 Pro
or fallback to Gemini 2.5 Pro.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> The **Keep trying** option uses exponential backoff, in which Gemini
> CLI waits longer between each retry, when the system is busy. If the retry
> doesn't happen immediately, wait a few minutes for the request to
> process.

### Model selection and routing types

When using Gemini CLI, you may want to control how your requests are routed
between models. By default, Gemini CLI uses **Auto** routing.

When using Gemini 3 Pro, you may want to use Auto routing or Pro routing to
manage your usage limits:

- **Auto routing:** Auto routing first determines whether a prompt involves a
  complex or simple operation. For simple prompts, it will automatically use
  Gemini 2.5 Flash. For complex prompts, if Gemini 3 Pro is enabled, it will use
  Gemini 3 Pro; otherwise, it will use Gemini 2.5 Pro.
- **Pro routing:** If you want to ensure your task is processed by the most
  capable model, use `/model` and select **Pro**. Gemini CLI will prioritize the
  most capable model available, including Gemini 3 Pro if it has been enabled.

To learn more about selecting a model and routing, refer to
[Gemini CLI Model Selection](../cli/model.md).

## How to enable Gemini 3 with Gemini CLI on Gemini Code Assist

If you're using Gemini Code Assist Standard or Gemini Code Assist Enterprise,
enabling Gemini 3 Pro on Gemini CLI requires configuring your release channels.
Using Gemini 3 Pro will require two steps: administrative enablement and user
enablement.

To learn more about these settings, refer to
[Configure Gemini Code Assist release channels](https://developers.google.com/gemini-code-assist/docs/configure-release-channels).

### Administrator instructions

An administrator with **Google Cloud Settings Admin** permissions must follow
these directions:

- Navigate to the Google Cloud Project you're using with Gemini CLI for Code
  Assist.
- Go to **Admin for Gemini** > **Settings**.
- Under **Release channels for Gemini Code Assist in local IDEs** select
  **Preview**.
- Click **Save changes**.

### User instructions

Wait for two to three minutes after your administrator has enabled **Preview**,
then:

- Open Gemini CLI.
- Use the `/settings` command.
- Set **Preview Features** to `true`.

Restart Gemini CLI and you should have access to Gemini 3.
