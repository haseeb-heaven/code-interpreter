# CLI commands

OpenAgent CLI supports several built-in commands to help you manage your
session, customize the interface, and control its behavior. These commands are
prefixed with a forward slash (`/`), an at symbol (`@`), or an exclamation mark
(`!`).

## Slash commands (`/`)

Slash commands provide meta-level control over the CLI itself.

### Built-in Commands

### `/about`

- **Description:** Show version info. Share this information when filing issues.

### `/agents`

- **Description:** Manage local and remote subagents.
- **Sub-commands:**
  - **`list`**:
    - **Description:** Lists all discovered agents, including built-in, local,
      and remote agents.
    - **Usage:** `/agents list`
  - **`reload`** (alias: `refresh`):
    - **Description:** Rescans agent directories (`~/.openagent/agents` and
      `.openagent/agents`) and reloads the registry.
    - **Usage:** `/agents reload`
  - **`enable`**:
    - **Description:** Enables a specific subagent.
    - **Usage:** `/agents enable <agent-name>`
  - **`disable`**:
    - **Description:** Disables a specific subagent.
    - **Usage:** `/agents disable <agent-name>`
  - **`config`**:
    - **Description:** Opens a configuration dialog for the specified agent to
      adjust its model, temperature, or execution limits.
    - **Usage:** `/agents config <agent-name>`

### `/auth`

- **Description:** Open a dialog that lets you change the authentication method.

### `/bug`

- **Description:** File an issue about OpenAgent CLI. By default, the issue is
  filed within the GitHub repository for OpenAgent CLI. The string you enter
  after `/bug` will become the headline for the bug being filed. The default
  `/bug` behavior can be modified using the `advanced.bugCommand` setting in
  your `.openagent/settings.json` files.

### `/chat`

- **Description:** Alias for `/resume`. Both commands now expose the same
  session browser action and checkpoint subcommands.
- **Menu layout when typing `/chat` (or `/resume`)**:
  - `-- auto --`
    - `list` (selecting this opens the auto-saved session browser)
  - `-- checkpoints --`
    - `list`, `save`, `resume`, `delete`, `share` (manual tagged checkpoints)
  - Unique prefixes (for example `/cha` or `/resu`) resolve to the same grouped
    menu.
- **Sub-commands:**
  - **`debug`**
    - **Description:** Export the most recent API request as a JSON payload.
  - **`delete <tag>`**
    - **Description:** Deletes a saved conversation checkpoint.
    - **Equivalent:** `/resume delete <tag>`
  - **`list`**
    - **Description:** Lists available tags for manually saved checkpoints.
    - **Note:** This command only lists chats saved within the current project.
      Because chat history is project-scoped, chats saved in other project
      directories will not be displayed.
    - **Equivalent:** `/resume list`
  - **`resume <tag>`**
    - **Description:** Resumes a conversation from a previous save.
    - **Note:** You can only resume chats that were saved within the current
      project. To resume a chat from a different project, you must run the
      OpenAgent CLI from that project's directory.
    - **Equivalent:** `/resume resume <tag>`
  - **`save <tag>`**
    - **Description:** Saves the current conversation history. You must add a
      `<tag>` for identifying the conversation state.
    - **Details on checkpoint location:** The default locations for saved chat
      checkpoints are:
      - Linux/macOS: `~/.openagent/tmp/<project_hash>/`
      - Windows: `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.openagent\tmp\<project_hash>\`
      - **Behavior:** Chats are saved into a project-specific directory,
        determined by where you run the CLI. Consequently, saved chats are only
        accessible when working within that same project.
      - **Note:** These checkpoints are for manually saving and resuming
        conversation states. For automatic checkpoints created before file
        modifications, see the
        [Checkpointing documentation](../cli/checkpointing.md).
      - **Equivalent:** `/resume save <tag>`
  - **`share [filename]`**
    - **Description:** Writes the current conversation to a provided Markdown or
      JSON file. If no filename is provided, then the CLI will generate one.
    - **Usage:** `/chat share file.md` or `/chat share file.json`.
    - **Equivalent:** `/resume share [filename]`

### `/clear`

- **Description:** Clear the terminal screen, including the visible session
  history and scrollback within the CLI. The underlying session data (for
  history recall) might be preserved depending on the exact implementation, but
  the visual display is cleared.
- **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+L** at any time to perform a clear action.

### `/commands`

- **Description:** Manage custom slash commands loaded from `.toml` files.
- **Sub-commands:**
  - **`list`**:
    - **Description:** List available custom command `.toml` files from all
      sources (user-level `~/.openagent/commands/`, project-level
      `<project>/.openagent/commands/`, and active extensions).
    - **Usage:** `/commands list`
  - **`reload`**:
    - **Description:** Reload custom command definitions from all sources
      (user-level `~/.openagent/commands/`, project-level
      `<project>/.openagent/commands/`, MCP prompts, and extensions). Use this
      to pick up new or modified `.toml` files without restarting the CLI.
    - **Usage:** `/commands reload`

### `/compress`

- **Description:** Replace the entire chat context with a summary. This saves on
  tokens used for future tasks while retaining a high level summary of what has
  happened.

### `/copy`

- **Description:** Copies the last output produced by OpenAgent CLI to your
  clipboard, for easy sharing or reuse.
- **Behavior:**
  - Local sessions use system clipboard tools (pbcopy/xclip/clip).
  - Remote sessions (SSH/WSL) use OSC 52 and require terminal support.
- **Note:** This command requires platform-specific clipboard tools to be
  installed.
  - On Linux, it requires `xclip` or `xsel`. You can typically install them
    using your system's package manager.
  - On macOS, it requires `pbcopy`, and on Windows, it requires `clip`. These
    tools are typically pre-installed on their respective systems.

### `/directory` (or `/dir`)

- **Description:** Manage workspace directories for multi-directory support.
- **Sub-commands:**
  - **`add`**:
    - **Description:** Add a directory to the workspace. The path can be
      absolute or relative to the current working directory. Moreover, the
      reference from home directory is supported as well.
    - **Usage:** `/directory add <path1>,<path2>`
    - **Note:** Disabled in restrictive sandbox profiles. If you're using that,
      use `--include-directories` when starting the session instead.
  - **`show`**:
    - **Description:** Display all directories added by `/directory add` and
      `--include-directories`.
    - **Usage:** `/directory show`

### Custom commands

Custom commands allow you to create personalized shortcuts for your most-used
prompts. For detailed instructions on how to create, manage, and use them, see
the dedicated [Custom Commands documentation](../cli/custom-commands.md).

## Input prompt shortcuts

These shortcuts apply directly to the input prompt for text manipulation.

- **Undo:**

  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Ctrl+z** (Windows), **Cmd+z** (macOS), or
    **Alt+z** (Linux/WSL) to undo the last action in the input prompt.

- **Redo:**
  - **Keyboard shortcut:** Press **Shift+Cmd+Z** (macOS), or **Shift+Alt+Z**
    (Linux/WSL) to redo the last undone action in the input prompt.

## At commands (`@`)

At commands are used to include the content of files or directories as part of
your prompt to Gemini. These commands include git-aware filtering.

- **`@<path_to_file_or_directory>`**

  - **Description:** Inject the content of the specified file or files into your
    current prompt. This is useful for asking questions about specific code,
    text, or collections of files.
  - **Examples:**
    - `@path/to/your/file.txt Explain this text.`
    - `@src/my_project/ Summarize the code in this directory.`
    - `What is this file about? @README.md`
  - **Details:**
    - If a path to a single file is provided, the content of that file is read.
    - If a path to a directory is provided, the command attempts to read the
      content of files within that directory and any subdirectories.
    - Spaces in paths should be escaped with a backslash (for example,
      `@My\ Documents/file.txt`).
    - The command uses the `read_many_files` tool internally. The content is
      fetched and then inserted into your query before being sent to the Gemini
      model.
    - **Git-aware filtering:** By default, git-ignored files (like
      `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `.env`, `.git/`) are excluded. This behavior can
      be changed via the `context.fileFiltering` settings.
    - **File types:** The command is intended for text-based files. While it
      might attempt to read any file, binary files or very large files might be
      skipped or truncated by the underlying `read_many_files` tool to ensure
      performance and relevance. The tool indicates if files were skipped.
  - **Output:** The CLI will show a tool call message indicating that
    `read_many_files` was used, along with a message detailing the status and
    the path(s) that were processed.

- **`@` (Lone at symbol)**
  - **Description:** If you type a lone `@` symbol without a path, the query is
    passed as-is to the Gemini model. This might be useful if you are
    specifically talking _about_ the `@` symbol in your prompt.

### Error handling for `@` commands

- If the path specified after `@` is not found or is invalid, an error message
  will be displayed, and the query might not be sent to the Gemini model, or it
  will be sent without the file content.
- If the `read_many_files` tool encounters an error (for example, permission
  issues), this will also be reported.

## Shell mode and passthrough commands (`!`)

The `!` prefix lets you interact with your system's shell directly from within
OpenAgent CLI.

- **`!<shell_command>`**

  - **Description:** Execute the given `<shell_command>` using `bash` on
    Linux/macOS or `powershell.exe -NoProfile -Command` on Windows (unless you
    override `ComSpec`). Any output or errors from the command are displayed in
    the terminal.
  - **Examples:**
    - `!ls -la` (executes `ls -la` and returns to OpenAgent CLI)
    - `!git status` (executes `git status` and returns to OpenAgent CLI)

- **`!` (Toggle shell mode)**

  - **Description:** Typing `!` on its own toggles shell mode.
    - **Entering shell mode:**
      - When active, shell mode uses a different coloring and a "Shell Mode
        Indicator".
      - While in shell mode, text you type is interpreted directly as a shell
        command.
    - **Exiting shell mode:**
      - When exited, the UI reverts to its standard appearance and normal
        OpenAgent CLI behavior resumes.

- **Caution for all `!` usage:** Commands you execute in shell mode have the
  same permissions and impact as if you ran them directly in your terminal.

- **Environment variable:** When a command is executed via `!` or in shell mode,
  the `GEMINI_CLI=1` environment variable is set in the subprocess's
  environment. This allows scripts or tools to detect if they are being run from
  within OpenAgent CLI.
