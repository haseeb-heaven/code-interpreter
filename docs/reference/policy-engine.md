# Policy engine

Gemini CLI includes a powerful policy engine that provides fine-grained control
over tool execution. It allows users and administrators to define rules that
determine whether a tool call should be allowed, denied, or require user
confirmation.

## Quick start

To create your first policy:

1.  **Create the policy directory** if it doesn't exist:

    **macOS/Linux**

    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/.gemini/policies
    ```

    **Windows (PowerShell)**

    ```powershell
    New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.gemini\policies"
    ```

2.  **Create a new policy file** (for example,
    `~/.gemini/policies/my-rules.toml`). You can use any filename ending in
    `.toml`; all such files in this directory will be loaded and combined:
    ```toml
    [[rule]]
    toolName = "run_shell_command"
    commandPrefix = "rm -rf"
    decision = "deny"
    priority = 100
    ```
3.  **Run a command** that triggers the policy (for example, ask Gemini CLI to
    `rm -rf /`). The tool will now be blocked automatically.

## Core concepts

The policy engine operates on a set of rules. Each rule is a combination of
conditions and a resulting decision. When a large language model wants to
execute a tool, the policy engine evaluates all rules to find the
highest-priority rule that matches the tool call.

A rule consists of the following main components:

- **Conditions**: Criteria that a tool call must meet for the rule to apply.
  This can include the tool's name, the arguments provided to it, or the current
  approval mode.
- **Decision**: The action to take if the rule matches (`allow`, `deny`, or
  `ask_user`).
- **Priority**: A number that determines the rule's precedence. Higher numbers
  win.

For example, this rule will ask for user confirmation before executing any `git`
command.

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 100
```

### Conditions

Conditions are the criteria that a tool call must meet for a rule to apply. The
primary conditions are the tool's name and its arguments.

#### Tool Name

The `toolName` in the rule must match the name of the tool being called. For a
complete list of built-in tool names, see the
[Tools reference](/docs/reference/tools#available-tools).

- **Wildcards**: You can use wildcards to match multiple tools.
  - `*`: Matches **any tool** (built-in or MCP).
  - `mcp_server_*`: Matches any tool from a specific MCP server.
  - `mcp_*_toolName`: Matches a specific tool name across **all** MCP servers.
  - `mcp_*`: Matches **any tool from any MCP server**.

> **Recommendation:** While FQN wildcards are supported, the recommended
> approach for MCP tools is to use the `mcpName` field in your TOML rules. See
> [Special syntax for MCP tools](#special-syntax-for-mcp-tools).

#### Arguments pattern

If `argsPattern` is specified, the tool's arguments are converted to a stable
JSON string, which is then tested against the provided regular expression. If
the arguments don't match the pattern, the rule does not apply. For a list of
argument keys available for each tool, see the **Parameters** in the
[Tools reference](/docs/reference/tools#available-tools).

#### Execution environment

If `interactive` is specified, the rule will only apply if the CLI's execution
environment matches the specified boolean value:

- `true`: The rule applies only in interactive mode.
- `false`: The rule applies only in non-interactive (headless) mode.

If omitted, the rule applies to both interactive and non-interactive
environments.

### Decisions

There are three possible decisions a rule can enforce:

- `allow`: The tool call is executed automatically without user interaction.
- `deny`: The tool call is blocked and is not executed. For global rules (those
  without an `argsPattern`), tools that are denied are **completely excluded
  from the model's memory**. This means the model will not even see the tool as
  an option, which is more secure and saves context window space.
- `ask_user`: The user is prompted to approve or deny the tool call. (In
  non-interactive mode, this is treated as `deny`.)

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> The `deny` decision is the recommended way to exclude tools. The
> legacy `tools.exclude` setting in `settings.json` is deprecated in favor of
> policy rules with a `deny` decision.

### Priority system and tiers

> [!WARNING] The **Workspace** tier (project-level policies) is currently
> non-functional. Defining policies in a workspace's `.gemini/policies`
> directory will not have any effect. See
> [issue #18186](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/18186). Use
> User or Admin policies instead.

The policy engine uses a sophisticated priority system to resolve conflicts when
multiple rules match a single tool call. The core principle is simple: **the
rule with the highest priority wins**.

To provide a clear hierarchy, policies are organized into three tiers. Each tier
has a designated number that forms the base of the final priority calculation.

| Tier      | Base | Description                                                                                   |
| :-------- | :--- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default   | 1    | Built-in policies that ship with Gemini CLI.                                                  |
| Extension | 2    | Policies defined in extensions.                                                               |
| Workspace | 3    | **(Currently disabled)** Policies defined in the current workspace's configuration directory. |
| User      | 4    | Custom policies defined by the user.                                                          |
| Admin     | 5    | Policies managed by an administrator (for example, in an enterprise environment).             |

Within a TOML policy file, you assign a priority value from **0 to 999**. The
engine transforms this into a final priority using the following formula:

`final_priority = tier_base + (toml_priority / 1000)`

This system guarantees that:

- Admin policies always override User, Workspace, and Default policies (defined
  in policy TOML files).
- User policies override Workspace and Default policies.
- Workspace policies override Default policies.
- You can still order rules within a single tier with fine-grained control.

For example:

- A `priority: 50` rule in a Default policy TOML becomes `1.050`.
- A `priority: 10` rule in a Workspace policy TOML becomes `2.010`.
- A `priority: 100` rule in a User policy TOML becomes `3.100`.
- A `priority: 20` rule in an Admin policy TOML becomes `4.020`.

### Approval modes

Approval modes allow the policy engine to apply different sets of rules based on
the CLI's operational mode. A rule in a TOML policy file can be associated with
one or more modes (for example, `yolo`, `autoEdit`, `plan`). The rule will only
be active if the CLI is running in one of its specified modes. If a rule has no
modes specified, it is always active.

- `default`: The standard interactive mode where most write tools require
  confirmation.
- `autoEdit`: Optimized for automated code editing; some write tools may be
  auto-approved.
- `plan`: A strict, read-only mode for research and design. See
  [Customizing Plan Mode Policies](../cli/plan-mode.md#customizing-policies).
- `yolo`: A mode where all tools are auto-approved (use with extreme caution).

To maintain the integrity of Plan Mode as a safe research environment,
persistent tool approvals are context-aware. When you select **"Allow for all
future sessions"**, the policy engine explicitly includes the current mode and
all more permissive modes in the hierarchy (`plan` < `default` < `autoEdit` <
`yolo`).

- **Approvals in `plan` mode**: These represent an intentional choice to trust a
  tool globally. The resulting rule explicitly includes all modes (`plan`,
  `default`, `autoEdit`, and `yolo`).
- **Approvals in other modes**: These only apply to the current mode and those
  more permissive. For example:
  - An approval granted in **`default`** mode applies to `default`, `autoEdit`,
    and `yolo`.
  - An approval granted in **`autoEdit`** mode applies to `autoEdit` and `yolo`.
  - An approval granted in **`yolo`** mode applies only to `yolo`. This ensures
    that trust flows correctly to more permissive environments while maintaining
    the safety of more restricted modes like `plan`.

## Rule matching

When a tool call is made, the engine checks it against all active rules,
starting from the highest priority. The first rule that matches determines the
outcome.

A rule matches a tool call if all of its conditions are met:

1.  **Tool name**: The `toolName` in the TOML rule must match the name of the
    tool being called.
    - **Wildcards**: You can use wildcards like `*`, `mcp_server_*`, or
      `mcp_*_toolName` to match multiple tools. See [Tool Name](#tool-name) for
      details.
2.  **Arguments pattern**: If `argsPattern` is specified, the tool's arguments
    are converted to a stable JSON string, which is then tested against the
    provided regular expression. If the arguments don't match the pattern, the
    rule does not apply.

## Configuration

Policies are defined in `.toml` files. The CLI loads these files from Default,
User, and (if configured) Admin directories.

### Policy locations

| Tier          | Type   | Location                                                 |
| :------------ | :----- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**      | Custom | `~/.gemini/policies/*.toml`                              |
| **Workspace** | Custom | **(Disabled)** `$WORKSPACE_ROOT/.gemini/policies/*.toml` |
| **Admin**     | System | _See below (OS specific)_                                |

#### System-wide policies (Admin)

Administrators can enforce system-wide policies (Tier 4) that override all user
and default settings. These policies can be loaded from standard system
locations or supplemental paths.

##### Standard Locations

These are the default paths the CLI searches for admin policies:

| OS          | Policy Directory Path                             |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linux**   | `/etc/gemini-cli/policies`                        |
| **macOS**   | `/Library/Application Support/GeminiCli/policies` |
| **Windows** | `C:\ProgramData\gemini-cli\policies`              |

##### Supplemental Admin Policies

Administrators can also specify supplemental policy paths using:

- The `--admin-policy` command-line flag.
- The `adminPolicyPaths` setting in a system settings file.

These supplemental policies are assigned the same **Admin** tier (Base 4) as
policies in standard locations.

**Security Guard**: Supplemental admin policies are **ignored** if any `.toml`
policy files are found in the standard system location. This prevents flag-based
overrides when a central system policy has already been established.

#### Security Requirements

To prevent privilege escalation, the CLI enforces strict security checks on the
**standard system policy directory**. If checks fail, the policies in that
directory are **ignored**.

- **Linux / macOS:** Must be owned by `root` (UID 0) and NOT writable by group
  or others (for example, `chmod 755`).
- **Windows:** Must be in `C:\ProgramData`. Standard users (`Users`, `Everyone`)
  must NOT have `Write`, `Modify`, or `Full Control` permissions. If you see a
  security warning, use the folder properties to remove write permissions for
  non-admin groups. You may need to "Disable inheritance" in Advanced Security
  Settings.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> Supplemental admin policies (provided via `--admin-policy` or
> `adminPolicyPaths` settings) are **NOT** subject to these strict ownership
> checks, as they are explicitly provided by the user or administrator in their
> current execution context.

### TOML rule schema

This section describes the fields available in a TOML policy rule.

For valid built-in `toolName` values and their argument structures (used by
`argsPattern`), see the
[Tools reference](/docs/reference/tools#available-tools).

```toml
[[rule]]
# A unique name for the tool, or an array of names.
toolName = "run_shell_command"

# (Optional) The name of a subagent. If provided, the rule only applies to tool
# calls made by this specific subagent.
subagent = "codebase_investigator"

# (Optional) The name of an MCP server. Can be combined with toolName
# to form a composite FQN internally like "mcp_mcpName_toolName".
mcpName = "my-custom-server"

# (Optional) Metadata hints provided by the tool. A rule matches if all
# key-value pairs provided here are present in the tool's annotations.
toolAnnotations = { readOnlyHint = true }

# (Optional) A regex to match against the tool's arguments.
argsPattern = '"command":"(git|npm)'

# (Optional) A string or array of strings that a shell command must start with.
# This is syntactic sugar for `toolName = "run_shell_command"` and an
# `argsPattern`.
commandPrefix = "git"

# (Optional) A regex to match against the entire shell command.
# This is also syntactic sugar for `toolName = "run_shell_command"`.
# Note: This pattern is tested against the JSON representation of the arguments
# (e.g., `{"command":"<your_command>"}`). Because it prepends `"command":"`,
# it effectively matches from the start of the command.
# Anchors like `^` or `$` apply to the full JSON string,
# so `^` should usually be avoided here.
# You cannot use commandPrefix and commandRegex in the same rule.
commandRegex = "git (commit|push)"

# The decision to take. Must be "allow", "deny", or "ask_user".
decision = "ask_user"

# The priority of the rule, from 0 to 999.
priority = 10

# (Optional) A custom message to display when a tool call is denied by this
# rule. This message is returned to the model and user,
# useful for explaining *why* it was denied.
denyMessage = "Deletion is permanent"

# (Optional) An array of approval modes where this rule is active.
# If omitted or empty, the rule applies to all modes.
modes = ["default", "autoEdit", "yolo"]

# (Optional) A boolean to restrict the rule to interactive (true) or
# non-interactive (false) environments.
# If omitted, the rule applies to both.
interactive = true

# (Optional) If true, lets shell commands use redirection operators
# (>, >>, <, <<, <<<). By default, the policy engine asks for confirmation
# when redirection is detected, even if a rule matches the command.
# This permission is granular; it only applies to the specific rule it's
# defined in. In chained commands (e.g., cmd1 > file && cmd2), each
# individual command rule must permit redirection if it's used.
allowRedirection = true
```

### Using arrays (lists)

To apply the same rule to multiple tools or command prefixes, you can provide an
array of strings for the `toolName` and `commandPrefix` fields.

**Example:**

This single rule will apply to both the `write_file` and `replace` tools.

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = ["write_file", "replace"]
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 10
```

### Special syntax for `run_shell_command`

To simplify writing policies for `run_shell_command`, you can use
`commandPrefix` or `commandRegex` instead of the more complex `argsPattern`.
These are policy-rule shorthands, not arguments of the `run_shell_command` tool
itself. For the tool's invocation arguments, see [Shell tool](/docs/tools/shell)
and [Tools reference](/docs/reference/tools#available-tools).

- `commandPrefix`: Matches if the `command` argument starts with the given
  string.
- `commandRegex`: Matches if the `command` argument matches the given regular
  expression.

**Example:**

This rule will ask for user confirmation before executing any `git` command.

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "run_shell_command"
commandPrefix = "git"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 100
```

### Special syntax for MCP tools

You can create rules that target tools from Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
using the `mcpName` field. **This is the recommended approach** for defining MCP
policies, as it is much more robust than manually writing Fully Qualified Names
(FQNs) or string wildcards.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!WARNING]
> Do not use underscores (`_`) in your MCP server names (for example, use
> `my-server` rather than `my_server`). The policy parser splits Fully Qualified
> Names (`mcp_server_tool`) on the _first_ underscore following the `mcp_`
> prefix. If your server name contains an underscore, the parser will
> misinterpret the server identity, which can cause wildcard rules and security
> policies to fail silently.

**1. Targeting a specific tool on a server**

Combine `mcpName` and `toolName` to target a single operation. When using
`mcpName`, the `toolName` field should strictly be the simple name of the tool
(for example, `search`), **not** the Fully Qualified Name (for example,
`mcp_server_search`).

```toml
# Allows the `search` tool on the `my-jira-server` MCP
[[rule]]
mcpName = "my-jira-server"
toolName = "search"
decision = "allow"
priority = 200
```

**2. Targeting all tools on a specific server**

Specify only the `mcpName` to apply a rule to every tool provided by that
server.

**Note:** This applies to all decision types (`allow`, `deny`, `ask_user`).

```toml
# Denies all tools from the `untrusted-server` MCP
[[rule]]
mcpName = "untrusted-server"
decision = "deny"
priority = 500
denyMessage = "This server is not trusted by the admin."
```

**3. Targeting all MCP servers**

Use `mcpName = "*"` to create a rule that applies to **all** tools from **any**
registered MCP server. This is useful for setting category-wide defaults.

```toml
# Ask user for any tool call from any MCP server
[[rule]]
toolName = "*"
mcpName = "*"
decision = "ask_user"
priority = 10
```

### Special syntax for subagents

You can secure and govern subagents using standard policy rules by treating the
subagent's name as the `toolName`.

When the main agent invokes a subagent (e.g., using the unified `invoke_agent`
tool), the Policy Engine automatically treats the target `agent_name` as a
virtual tool alias for rule matching.

**Example:**

This rule denies access to the `codebase_investigator` subagent.

```toml
[[rule]]
toolName = "codebase_investigator"
decision = "deny"
priority = 500
deny_message = "Deep codebase analysis is restricted for this session."
```

- **Backward Compatibility**: Any rules written targeting historical 1:1
  subagent tool names will continue to match transparently.
- **Context differentiation**: To create rules based on **who** is calling a
  tool, use the `subagent` field instead. See
  [TOML rule schema](#toml-rule-schema).

## Default policies

Gemini CLI ships with a set of default policies to provide a safe out-of-the-box
experience.

- **Read-only tools** (like `read_file`, `glob`) are generally **allowed**.
- **Agent delegation** defaults to **`ask_user`** to ensure remote agents can
  prompt for confirmation, but local sub-agent actions are executed silently and
  checked individually.
- **Write tools** (like `write_file`, `run_shell_command`) default to
  **`ask_user`**.
- In **`yolo`** mode, a high-priority rule allows all tools.
- In **`autoEdit`** mode, rules allow certain write operations to happen without
  prompting.
