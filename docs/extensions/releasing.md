# Release extensions

Release Gemini CLI extensions to your users through a Git repository or GitHub
Releases. This guide explains how to share your work, list it in the gallery,
and manage updates.

Git repository releases are the simplest approach and offer the most flexibility
for managing development branches. GitHub Releases are more efficient for
initial installations because they ship as single archives rather than requiring
a full `git clone`. Use GitHub Releases if you need to include platform-specific
binary files.

## List your extension in the gallery

The [Gemini CLI extension gallery](https://geminicli.com/extensions/browse/)
automatically indexes public extensions to help users discover your work. You
don't need to submit an issue or email us to list your extension.

To have your extension automatically discovered and listed:

1.  **Use a public repository:** Ensure your extension is hosted in a public
    GitHub repository.
2.  **Add the GitHub topic:** Add the `gemini-cli-extension` topic to your
    repository's **About** section. Our crawler uses this topic to find new
    extensions.
3.  **Place the manifest at the root:** Ensure your `gemini-extension.json` file
    is in the absolute root of the repository or the release archive.

Our system crawls tagged repositories daily. Once you tag your repository, your
extension will appear in the gallery if it passes validation.

## Release through a Git repository

Releasing through Git is the most flexible option. Create a public Git
repository and provide the URL to your users. They can then install your
extension using `gemini extensions install <your-repo-uri>`.

Users can optionally depend on a specific branch, tag, or commit using the
`--ref` argument. For example:

```bash
gemini extensions install <your-repo-uri> --ref=stable
```

Whenever you push commits to the referenced branch, the CLI prompts users to
update their installation. The `HEAD` commit is always treated as the latest
version.

### Manage release channels

You can use branches or tags to manage different release channels, such as
`stable`, `preview`, or `dev`.

We recommend using your default branch as the stable release channel. This
ensures that the default installation command always provides the most reliable
version of your extension. You can then use a `dev` branch for active
development and merge it into the default branch when you are ready for a
release.

## Release through GitHub Releases

Distributing extensions through
[GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)
provides a faster installation experience by avoiding a repository clone.

Gemini CLI checks for updates by looking for the **Latest** release on GitHub.
Users can also install specific versions using the `--ref` argument with a
release tag. Use the `--pre-release` flag to install the latest version even if
it isn't marked as **Latest**.

### Custom pre-built archives

You can attach custom archives directly to your GitHub Release as assets. This
is useful if your extension requires a build step or includes platform-specific
binaries.

Custom archives must be fully self-contained and follow the required
[archive structure](#archive-structure). If your extension is
platform-independent, provide a single generic asset.

#### Platform-specific archives

To let Gemini CLI find the correct asset for a user's platform, use the
following naming convention:

1.  **Platform and architecture-specific:**
    `{platform}.{arch}.{name}.{extension}`
2.  **Platform-specific:** `{platform}.{name}.{extension}`
3.  **Generic:** A single asset will be used as a fallback if no specific match
    is found.

Use these values for the placeholders:

- `{name}`: Your extension name.
- `{platform}`: Use `darwin` (macOS), `linux`, or `win32` (Windows).
- `{arch}`: Use `x64` or `arm64`.
- `{extension}`: Use `.tar.gz` or `.zip`.

**Examples:**

- `darwin.arm64.my-tool.tar.gz` (specific to Apple Silicon Macs)
- `darwin.my-tool.tar.gz` (fallback for all Macs, for example Intel)
- `linux.x64.my-tool.tar.gz`
- `win32.my-tool.zip`

#### Archive structure

Archives must be fully contained extensions. The `gemini-extension.json` file
must be at the root of the archive. The rest of the layout should match a
standard extension structure.

#### Example GitHub Actions workflow

Use this example workflow to build and release your extension for multiple
platforms:

```yaml
name: Release Extension

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build extension
        run: npm run build

      - name: Create release assets
        run: |
          npm run package -- --platform=darwin --arch=arm64
          npm run package -- --platform=linux --arch=x64
          npm run package -- --platform=win32 --arch=x64

      - name: Create GitHub Release
        uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
        with:
          files: |
            release/darwin.arm64.my-tool.tar.gz
            release/linux.arm64.my-tool.tar.gz
            release/win32.arm64.my-tool.zip
```

## Migrate an extension repository

If you move your extension to a new repository or rename it, use the
`migratedTo` property in `gemini-extension.json` to seamlessly transition your
users.

1.  **Create the new repository:** Set up your extension in its new location.
2.  **Update the old repository:** In your original repository, update the
    `gemini-extension.json` file to include the `migratedTo` property pointing
    to the new repository URL, and increment the version number.
    ```json
    {
      "name": "my-extension",
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "migratedTo": "https://github.com/new-owner/new-extension-repo"
    }
    ```
3.  **Release the update:** Publish this new version in your old repository.

When users check for updates, Gemini CLI detects the `migratedTo` field,
verifies the new repository, and automatically updates their local installation
to track the new source. All settings migrate automatically.

## How updates work

Gemini CLI automatically checks for extension updates based on the installation
method. Understanding these mechanisms helps you ensure your users always have
the latest version.

### Sync manifest and tags

For GitHub releases, always ensure the `version` in `gemini-extension.json`
matches your GitHub release tag. While the CLI uses tags for update detection,
it displays the manifest version in the UI. Keeping them in sync prevents
confusion.

### Update mechanisms

<details>
<summary>Technical update details</summary>

The CLI uses different strategies depending on the installation type:

- **GitHub releases:** The CLI queries the GitHub API for the latest release
  tag. It ignores the `version` field in the manifest for detection.
- **Git clones:** The CLI runs `git ls-remote` to compare the latest remote
  commit hash with your local `HEAD`.
- **Local extensions:** The CLI compares the `version` field in the source
  directory's manifest with the installed version.

To verify an extension's installation type, inspect the `type` field in the
metadata file at `~/.gemini/extensions/<name>/.gemini-extension-install.json`.
