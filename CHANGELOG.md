## Unreleased

## v4.1.2 (2026-07-22) — Session resume & free-fallback fixes

- fix(core): resuming a session (`--resume`) no longer breaks strict
  OpenAI-compat providers (Cerebras) with "Tool call with id ... was not found
  in the messages" — resumed history now re-derives functionCall parts from the
  persisted `toolCalls` records and synthesizes declarations for responses to
  unregistered/hallucinated tools
- fix(core): tool-call id prefix stripping is now decided once per id and
  applied to both the call and its response, so pairs whose names diverge
  (nameless hallucinated call vs arg-shape-recovered response) stay paired
- fix(core): nameless hallucinated tool calls now get the `generic_tool`
  fallback name written back into history, fixing Gemini's
  "function_response.name: Name cannot be empty" rejection
- fix(providers): when every free-fallback model fails, the error now lists each
  model with an actionable reason (rate limited, out of credits, request too
  large, invalid key, server down) instead of only the last candidate's error —
  which was always lmstudio's meaningless "connection refused" and masked the
  real failures
- fix(catalog): removed models OpenRouter now 404s — `tencent/hy3:free` (free
  promo ended 2026-07-21), `qwen/qwen3-coder:free`,
  `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`

## v4.1.1 (2026-07-21) — Post-release fixes

Bugfix release layered on v4.1.0's free-model picker and extensions marketplace
features. Note on numbering: `origin/main` already has an unrelated v4.1.0
(provider crash / homedir-mock fixes) that never merged into `develop` — this
avoids perpetuating that collision rather than reusing `4.1.0` on `develop` for
a second, different release.

- fix(tui): `/free-models` key-entry dialog now rejects structurally-invalid
  input (leftover slash-command keystrokes, strings under 16 chars) before
  writing to `.env`, instead of silently persisting garbage as an API key
- fix(providers): `resolveRegistryPath` now walks upward from `cwd` for
  `configs/models.toml` before falling back to a bundle-relative search, so
  running from a repo subdirectory no longer risks pinning a stale
  `bundle/configs/models.toml` copy for the process lifetime
- fix(test): resolve a hanging/flaky kitty-protocol test suite in
  `gemini.test.tsx` — mock out `interactiveCli.js`'s heavy Ink render for tests
  that only assert on pre-render terminal setup, and extend timeouts for tests
  that legitimately pay the cold-import transform cost
- fix(test): clear the `cleanup.ts` force-exit timer on test teardown
  (`resetCleanupForTesting`) so it can no longer fire after a test's mocked
  `process.exit` has been restored, which was surfacing as unhandled
  `process.exit unexpectedly called` exceptions in unrelated test runs
- fix(scripts): live-test harness (`run-live-tests.mjs`) retries once on timeout
  before grading a scenario FAIL, and flags scenarios whose prompt references a
  `LIVE_TEST_MEDIA_DIR` subfolder that doesn't exist, so an environment gap no
  longer reads as a silent false "OK"

## v4.1.0 (2026-07-21) — Free-model picker & extension marketplace

- feat(tui): `/free-models` is now an interactive picker dialog (was a static
  text listing) — browse the free/local catalog, select an entry, enter and save
  a provider API key inline when one is required, and switch models without
  leaving the session; `/free` remains as an alias
- feat(extensions): `/extensions market` opens a real marketplace browser
  (`MarketExtensionsView` + `marketplaceAdapters`) — pick a registry source
  (e.g. the Claude Code or Codex marketplaces), browse it live, and install/link
  an extension with `installRef`/`installSubdir` wired through; bare
  `/extensions` now reopens the last-selected market instead of always falling
  back to the installed list
- fix(providers): add the missing `provider = "openai"` field to several
  `configs/models.toml` entries (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`,
  `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-5.4*`, `gpt-5.6*`, `o3`, `o3-mini`, `o4-mini`) so registry
  routing resolves them correctly instead of throwing "No provider route found"
- chore(config): default `.openagent/settings.json` now ships tool sandboxing
  enabled (`security.toolSandboxing`, `tools.sandboxAllowedPaths`,
  `tools.sandboxNetworkAccess`)
- test: add component coverage for `FreeModelDialog` and `MarketExtensionsView`

- fix(tui): rename the interactive model picker command to `/models` (with
  `/model` retained as a compatibility alias); unavailable paid-provider models
  now offer their provider-specific `.env` key setup directly in the dialog
- fix(providers): preserve unique registry-key routing and endpoint overrides
  when aliases share a LiteLLM model id; free sessions now rotate through the
  fallback catalog after rate-limit or free-router failures
- test(providers): add fallback-chain coverage and validate OpenRouter's
  `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` with both complete and streaming live requests
- docs: update the branch-specific clone command; document `/models`,
  `--resume`, and `--yolo`

## v4.0.0 (2026-07-15) — OpenAgent

**Project renamed to OpenAgent** — an open-source agent that performs your tasks
using open-source free models, local models, and bring-your-own-key frontier
models. The Python interpreter codebase is replaced by a TypeScript agent
platform (forked from an Apache-2.0 terminal agent codebase, fully de-branded
and rebuilt around multi-provider routing).

- feat(rename): application is now **OpenAgent**; new `openagent` binary (the
  legacy `gemini` alias still works)
- feat(providers): local-first routing — Ollama at `localhost:11434` is the
  default provider (models auto-detected via `/api/tags`, no API key); LM Studio
  at `localhost:1234` via its OpenAI-compatible API
- feat(providers): BYOK cloud providers via LiteLLM-style `provider/model` ids —
  OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, NVIDIA, Together AI, HuggingFace,
  OpenRouter, Cerebras, Z.ai (one env key each)
- feat(config): single-file `configs/models.toml` registry carried over from
  v3.6.0 — `[models.*]`, `[[free_catalog]]`, `[[default_priority]]`; add
  models/providers by editing one file, no code changes
- feat(free): free-model fallback chain with rate-limit/routing-failure
  classification and retry-after parsing; local models are the final fallback of
  every chain
- feat(cli): `--provider`, `--free`, `--pick`, `--byok` flags; `-m/--model`
  accepts registry keys, free-catalog ids, and `provider/model` ids
- feat(repl): `/model` model picker grouped by provider with (`/pick` kept as a
  compatibility alias) vision/streaming/key-availability markers; `/byok` writes
  keys to `.env` and reports newly unlocked models
- feat(auth): no account, no sign-in flow, no vendor credentials shipped — a new
  multi-provider auth type bypasses vendor authentication entirely
- test: unit tests for provider detection (Ollama/LM Studio), registry, picker
  grouping, BYOK writing, the full free fallback chain, per-provider wiring, and
  a registry-wide suite covering every model entry; live local + cloud
  integration tests (skipped in CI / without keys)
- docs: README, Models.MD, and this changelog rewritten for OpenAgent

## v3.6.0 (2026-07-14)

- fix(key-manager): `AllKeysExhaustedError` now carries structured
  `provider`/`retry_after_eta` attributes instead of a plain message, so callers
  can classify and react instead of string-matching (`libs/key_manager.py`)
- refactor(errors): extract shared billing/auth-vs-rate-limit classification
  (`libs/core/error_classification.py`) so product code and tests never drift on
  what counts as "exhausted"
- fix(repl): the classic `--cli` REPL catches `AllKeysExhaustedError` and
  reports it cleanly instead of crashing with a raw traceback
- feat(model-router): attempt one free-model fallback before surfacing key
  exhaustion to the user (parity with the existing agentic/yolo fallback
  behavior)
- fix(ui): persistent banner/status line forces crop-overflow and cross-checks
  terminal width so it never wraps or truncates on narrow terminals
  (`libs/agent/gemini_ui.py`, `libs/core/session.py`)
- test(live-scenarios): committed representative fixtures and added 10 new
  create/analyze/summarize/convert/edit `ScenarioCase`s covering `zip`, `mp3`,
  `java`, `sqlite`, `docx`, `svg`, `webm` — stdlib-only, no
  `javac`/`python-docx`/video codec dependency in CI
- test(model-router): lock in multi-key rotation behavior on retry as a
  regression guard
- test(e2e): fill remaining all-modes smoke gaps (yolo, gemini-style, and other
  previously-uncovered modes)
- fix(live-scenarios): coalesce blank LLM content responses and wire `--search`
  into the classic one-shot flow (found and fixed during the live scenario
  re-run)
- fix(resilience): bound `litellm.completion()` calls with a 90s request timeout
  to stop indefinite hangs
- fix(web-search): correct DDGS import order, resolve a chart prompt-injection
  contradiction, and scope live-flake soft-skip handling correctly
- fix(windows): force `legacy_windows=False` on every `rich.Console()`
  construction site — rich's auto-detected legacy-console path raised
  `OSError: Bad file descriptor` when stdout was redirected to a file/pipe
- fix(tests): `tests/interactive/helpers.py`'s shared mock interpreter now
  explicitly returns `None` from `extract_file_name`; left unconfigured, the
  `MagicMock` default `__index__` (`1`) caused `main_loop.py`'s file-attachment
  branch to silently open/close real stdout (fd 1), corrupting it for the
  remainder of the test run (`OSError: Bad file descriptor`, CPython exit
  code 120) — root-caused and fixed across all 19 test files sharing the helper
- feat(providers): add Cerebras (cloud.cerebras.ai, ultra-fast LPU inference) as
  a fully wired model provider — `cerebras-gpt-oss-120b`,
  `cerebras-gemma-4-31b`, `cerebras-zai-glm-4.7` in `configs/models.toml`
  (litellm `cerebras/<model>` dispatch, `CEREBRAS_API_KEY`),
  `[[default_priority]]` row, and `[[free_catalog]]` entries (Cerebras public
  endpoints are free, rate-limited); key routing added to
  `ModelRouter.initialize_client`/`_resolve_api_key_name`,
  `libs/llm_dispatcher.py::_detect_provider`, and
  `libs/key_manager.py::PROVIDER_ENV_MAP`; `.env.example`/README updated; new
  `TestCerebrasProviderConfig` suite in `tests/test_all_model_configs.py`
- feat(tui): Persist no-args wizard answers to `~/.code-interpreter/config.json`
  (`libs/core/wizard_config.py`); bare `python interpreter.py` skips the wizard
  and reuses saved settings once one exists; new `--config` flag forces the
  wizard to (re)run and re-save. Explicit CLI flags still take precedence over
  both the saved config and the wizard. Never persists API keys/secrets or
  one-shot `--task`/`-f` text.
- fix(tui): "Configure advanced options?" → **no** now genuinely skips _every_
  subsequent advanced prompt (session, YOLO, `--yes`, science,
  interactive-charts, image, attach, MCP), instead of still asking for the
  session name right after.
- fix(tui): Cancelling a wizard selector (Ctrl+C / Esc) no longer produces an
  unhandled `KeyboardInterrupt` traceback; `interpreter.py:main()` catches it
  around `prepare_args()` and exits cleanly with a short `Cancelled.` message.
- test(ci): raised combined `libs` coverage to 81% (≥80% gate); fixed a
  CI-breaking bug where a live-scenario test required
  `INTERPRETER_TEST_DATA_DIR` that `ci.yml` never sets

## v3.5.0 (2026-07-12)

- feat(agentic/ux): `--agentic` default live view now shows only "Thought"
  panels, back-to-back — suppresses per-step "Action"/"Observation" panels and
  retry/rate-limit/fallback log chatter; final result and workflow
  Status/Steps/Tokens/Cost summary still print, and `logs/agent_react.jsonl`
  trajectory logging is unaffected. New `--verbose`/`-V` flag (and in-REPL
  `/verbose` toggle) restores the full detailed view (`libs/agent/step_ui.py`,
  `libs/agent/react_controller.py`, `libs/agent/llm.py`)
- refactor(config): replace the `configs/` folder's ~70 per-model JSON files
  (plus `configs/free/catalog.json` and `configs/schema.json`) with a single
  human-editable `configs/models.toml` registry (`[models."<key>"]` tables,
  `[[default_priority]]`, `[[free_catalog]]`)
- feat(config): `libs/core/model_registry.py` — cached `tomllib`/`tomli`-backed
  loader
  (`ModelRegistry.load/get_model/has_model/list_model_names/default_model_name/free_catalog_entries`);
  adds `tomli; python_version < "3.11"` to `requirements.txt`
- refactor(models): `libs/free_llms.py`, `libs/utility_manager.py`,
  `libs/core/model_router.py`, `libs/core/session.py`,
  `libs/interpreter_lib.py`, `libs/core/main_loop.py` now resolve models via
  `ModelRegistry` instead of `configs/<name>.json` paths; `/model`, `--free`,
  `--list-free`, `--gemini-style`, `-m <model>` behavior is unchanged end-to-end
- chore(scripts): `scripts/smoke_all_models.py`,
  `scripts/config_builder.sh`/`.bat` updated to read/append
  `configs/models.toml` instead of per-model JSON files
- docs: README/AGENTS.md updated to document the `configs/models.toml` registry
  and how to add custom models/providers without touching Python code

## v3.4.0 (2026-07-12)

- fix(agentic/yolo): AutoLoop treats malformed tool XML (`<write_file` /
  `</function>`) as repairable failure and retries (cap 8) instead of exiting;
  skip OpenRouter free early when tools unsupported; require real tool_calls for
  chart/file tasks
- fix(agentic/yolo): AutoLoop OR `RateLimitError` (`free-models-per-day` /
  `Provider returned error`) jumps to Groq/Gemini immediately without burning
  sibling OpenRouter `:free` slots; pass config basename into AutoLoop
- feat(ux): Gemini-style step UX for ReAct/agentic + YOLO AutoLoop —
  Thinking/Executing/Searching spinners and Thought→Action→Observation panels
  (`libs/agent/step_ui.py`)
- feat(agentic): Missing-binary recovery (ffmpeg, etc.) — detect PATH failures,
  optional web search, ask before winget/choco/apt/brew install (yolo+yes
  auto-approves; yolo alone still asks)
- fix(agentic/yolo): AutoLoop free-catalog fallback on `free-models-per-day` /
  OpenRouter 429 / Stealth 502 (skip remaining OR free → Groq/Gemini/HF);
  `/model` and settings-like slash commands open TUI pickers; resolve
  `configs/<name>.json` basenames (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- fix(live-session): parse OpenRouter retry-after (cap 60s); skip daily
  free-quota models; YOLO tool_use_failed repair; REPL paste/slash guards;
  `.json` not vision; sandbox HOME/MPLCONFIGDIR/Plotly; user-intent absolute
  writes; neutralize tkinter.mainloop; short litellm errors
- test(fixtures): committed `tests/fixtures/` inputs/expected as live-scenario
  source of truth (`INTERPRETER_TEST_DATA_DIR` workdir copy)
- test(live): easy/medium/complex scenario suite + master
  `scratch/live_scenario_report.md|.html` (FAIL=0 soft-skip)
- fix(agentic): Free-LLM resilience — drop dead OpenRouter `:free` catalog IDs;
  treat 429/RateLimitError as routing failure with capped sleep/retry then
  catalog fallback; keep controller+specialist models in sync after fallback;
  `/model` lists presets; suppress rate-limit traceback dumps
- test(unit): raise `libs/*` + `interpreter.py` coverage to ≥80% (worktree unit
  suite); make data/output/context/local unit modules discoverable under
  `unittest discover -s tests`
- test(integration): expand mocked CLI/pipeline/tools/session coverage (25/25
  worktree integration suite)
- test(live): provider × mode × language matrix + agentic media suite with
  soft-skip (FAIL=0)
- test(interactive): slash commands, REPL loop, session round-trip, live exec,
  streaming, -f prompt coverage (#226)
- feat(security): subprocess/Docker sandbox backends, `--timeout`/`--safety`
  levels, audit log, secret scan, path ignore (#225)
- test(ci): Matrix CI (3 OS × 3 Python), critical-module coverage ≥60%, Codecov
  badge, shared pytest fixtures (#224)
- feat(science): NumPy/SciPy prompting, notebook export, plot themes, ML
  helpers, PDF reports, auto-install (#223)
- feat(data): analysis engine with smart ingest, Auto-EDA, chart gallery,
  multi-format export, SQL, clean (#222)
- feat(local): file attach context (`--attach` / `/file`) + Ollama/`--local`
  first-class support (#221)
- feat(ux): identity repositioning + first-run onboarding as free/local code
  interpreter (#220)
- feat(session): Persistent `--session` / `--list-sessions` / `--delete-session`
  / `/session` across runs (#218)
- feat(output): Structured `--output-format json|markdown|plain` with non-TTY
  auto-JSON (#219)
- feat(codegen): `--mode generate` snippet + `--mode project` scaffold without
  execution (#212)
- feat(tools): Native FS/shell ToolRegistry tools + `--yolo` autonomous tool
  loop + MCP stdio client (`--mcp-server`) (#215)
- feat(ux): Token streaming (`--stream` / `--no-stream`) + multimodal `--image`
  / `/image` input (#216)
- feat(tools): Web search tool `--search` / `/search` (DuckDuckGo / Tavily /
  Serper) (#217)
- docs: OSS comparison table (Open-Interpreter, Aider, OpenCode, Gemini CLI,
  Cline)
- docs: README sections for data analysis, science mode, Ollama/local attach,
  sandbox levels, sessions, output formats
- test: Expanded unit/integration/interactive coverage; live soft-skip for
  quota/rate-limit providers

## v3.3.0 (2026-07-11)

- feat(agentic): Gemini-CLI-style `--gemini-style` ReAct REPL with free/cheap
  LLM catalog (`--free`, `--list-free`, `/free`)
- feat(resilience): Multi-key rotation, token-bucket rate limiter, circuit
  breaker, error classifier, jitter backoff (`libs/key_manager.py`,
  `libs/rate_limiter.py`)
- feat(observability): `logs/metrics.jsonl` plus `/key-status`, `/reload-keys`,
  `/metrics` CLI commands
- feat(ci): Non-interactive `--yes` / `INTERPRETER_YES` one-shot file mode for
  scripted e2e
- feat(agents): Multi-agent pipeline (`--agent`) and ReAct `--agentic`
  coder/executor/reviewer/debugger loop
- docs: Fresh CLI screenshots for help, free catalog, code/chat modes,
  gemini-style, and agentic runs
- test: Resilience smoke suite, mode e2e harness, live soft-skip for
  quota/rate-limit providers
